Today, Parliament discussed various pressing issues, including pharmacare, housing, and foreign interference in elections.

The Bloc Quebecois was criticized for supporting the Liberal government's spending, which is seen as wasteful and not benefiting Canadians. Meanwhile, the opposition parties were accused of being opposed to the federal government providing contraceptives or diabetes medications without understanding the context and benefits of pharmacare.

The Canadian Dental Association (CDA) was established to address gaps in the country's pharmaceutical system, building on existing work streams such as improving prescribing and use of medications. The CDA will support pharmaceutical system modernization in Canada and lay a strong foundation for future growth.

The government introduced Bill to improve medication accessibility and affordability, aiming to reduce out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, particularly for seniors and young people. This bill is an important step towards national universal pharmacare, which would help reduce healthcare system costs over the long term.

Other pressing issues discussed in Parliament included housing costs, food bank usage, mental health, and foreign interference in elections. The government was accused of using power and control to manipulate the public, setting unrealistic expectations, and only delivering for a select few.

In conclusion, pharmacare is an important issue that requires careful consideration and consultation with stakeholders. The Canadian government must take a comprehensive and evidence-based approach to creating a universal pharmacare program.
