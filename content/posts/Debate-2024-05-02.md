Today, the parliament debated the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) bill, with critics arguing that it will allow fraudulent serial numbers to go undetected, contributing to the surge in car thefts across the country. The Bloc Quebecois pointed out that Longueuil has seen a significant increase in auto thefts and suggested studying this issue further.

The opposition party criticized the Liberal government's handling of motor vehicle thefts, citing a lack of accountability within the justice system. They argued that Bill C-46 will only make things worse by allowing judges to sentence criminals to serve their sentences at home instead of in jail.

On the other hand, the Liberal government emphasized its proactive efforts to address vehicle thefts, investing tens of millions of dollars and working with stakeholders to reduce the issue. However, opponents argue that this approach has not been effective in dealing with organized crime and gang-related activity.

As the debate continues, Canadians are left wondering what can be done to combat the rising trend of car thefts and ensure a sense of security on our streets.
