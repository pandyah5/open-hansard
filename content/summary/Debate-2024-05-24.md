**A Call to Action: Ending Liberal Failures in Canada**
=========================================================

The current Liberal government has consistently failed Quebec and Canada on multiple fronts, from dental insurance and health transfers to immigration, language, and secularism. The root cause of these failures lies in the government's refusal to respect provincial jurisdictions and its centralizing ideology, leading to numerous intrusions and abuses.

It is imperative that we put an end to these transgressions and recognize Quebec's right to opt out with full compensation. This requires a fundamental shift in how our government operates, prioritizing the principles of federalism and provincial autonomy.
