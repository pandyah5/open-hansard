Today, the parliament discussed various issues related to justice, disability support, and victim's rights. The government has invested heavily in a nationwide disability program, providing additional support for individuals receiving care and enhancing opportunities for caregivers.

The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Arif Virani, was questioned about repeat offenders who break into houses to steal vehicles. While the minister refused to answer questions directly, he emphasized the government's efforts to strengthen the bail system and address auto theft.

Virani also highlighted the government's commitment to supporting caregivers and individuals with disabilities, even if they are not directly addressed in the budget. He noted that a reduction in criminal legal aid funding was actually a one-time allocation being eliminated, and that the government is committing to a five-year horizon of criminal legal aid with an increased envelope of $440 million.

The parliament also discussed reforms to the superior court judicial appointments process, which aim to ensure transparency, merit, and diversity. Virani emphasized that partisanship, donation history, and political involvement have no impact on appointments, and that the goal is to appoint outstanding jurists who serve Canadians well.

Additionally, the government proposed to improve access to legal aid, particularly for vulnerable groups such as refugees and asylum seekers. The budget includes $273.7 million over five years for immigration and refugee legal aid services, aiming to ensure fair and compassionate decision-making in immigration proceedings.

Overall, the parliament's discussion highlighted the government's efforts to support caregivers, individuals with disabilities, and victims of crime, while also addressing issues related to justice and fairness.
**Today the Parliament Talked About**

In a packed day of discussions, the Canadian parliament tackled various pressing issues. One topic that garnered significant attention was the government's approach to drug use. The Conservative Party called for stricter laws and a ban on hard drugs, while others advocated for legalization. Meanwhile, concerns about public safety and health were raised in British Columbia, where hard drugs are openly used in hospitals and coffee shops.

**International Affairs**

The parliament also touched upon international issues. For instance, the government was urged to condemn the Iranian regime's actions against rapper Toomaj Salehi, who has been sentenced to death for demanding civil rights. Additionally, there were discussions on the 140th anniversary of U.S. diplomatic presence in Winnipeg, highlighting the strong ties between Canada and the United States.

**Leadership Contest**

The parliament also witnessed a development in the Liberal Party leadership contest. Mark Carney, a former Bank of Canada governor, announced his candidacy for the position. Some Conservative MPs have called for him to testify before a parliamentary committee, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest.

**Budget and Social Safety Net**

In another significant discussion, the parliament talked about the government's budget and plans for enhancing the social safety net. The government aims to invest in various initiatives, including pharmacare, dental care plans, and a new disability benefit with up to $6.1 billion over three years.

**Brain Injuries**

The parliament also discussed brain injuries, highlighting their significance and the need for a national strategy to address this issue. A bill was introduced aiming to develop such a strategy, which includes measures like promoting research and data collection, creating national guidelines for prevention, diagnosis, and management of brain injuries, and fostering collaboration with organizations working in this field.

These were some of the key issues that dominated the day's discussions in the Canadian parliament.
**Parliament Discusses CBSA Bill Amidst Rising Car Theft Concerns**

Today, the parliament debated the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) bill, with critics arguing that it will allow fraudulent serial numbers to go undetected, contributing to the surge in car thefts across the country. The Bloc Quebecois pointed out that Longueuil has seen a significant increase in auto thefts and suggested studying this issue further.

The opposition party criticized the Liberal government's handling of motor vehicle thefts, citing a lack of accountability within the justice system. They argued that Bill C-46 will only make things worse by allowing judges to sentence criminals to serve their sentences at home instead of in jail.

On the other hand, the Liberal government emphasized its proactive efforts to address vehicle thefts, investing tens of millions of dollars and working with stakeholders to reduce the issue. However, opponents argue that this approach has not been effective in dealing with organized crime and gang-related activity.

As the debate continues, Canadians are left wondering what can be done to combat the rising trend of car thefts and ensure a sense of security on our streets.
