Here is a coherent article summarizing the text:

The Canadian government has been under fire for its handling of various issues, including its budget, tax policies, and investments in agriculture. Critics argue that the government's slow pace of processing AgriRecovery program claims is unacceptable, and that it needs to prioritize small businesses and indigenous communities.

On a broader scale, Canadians are calling for change from the current government, demanding a balanced budget, reduced debt, and lower taxes. The proposed federal property tax has been particularly unpopular, as it would give municipalities control over tax rates and incentivize lobbying.

The budget itself has been criticized by various parties. The NDP fought to include a national school food program, pharmacare with access to free contraception and diabetes medication, but the Conservatives voted against these initiatives. The government has also been accused of failing to provide access to safe, trauma-informed abortion care, forcing people to travel long distances or seek out-of-country services.

The Bloc Québécois supports the budget because it invests in housing, healthcare, and education. However, the NDP criticizes the budget for not doing enough to support people living with disabilities and those struggling with affordability.

Meanwhile, the Conservative Party has been accused of violating a 10-year-old ruling by the Speaker regarding questions of privilege. This has led to accusations of disrespecting the institution.

The government has also been criticized for its lack of investment in national security, international trade, and housing. The high cost of living is another major concern, with many Canadians struggling to make ends meet.

In a positive note, there are efforts underway to address affordability and accessibility issues. Advocates are calling for missing middle housing, and the government has committed to investing in affordable housing and modular housing. Additionally, the government has proposed a national school food program and pharmacare with access to free contraception and diabetes medication.

Ultimately, the debate highlights the differing views on the role of the federal government in addressing social and economic issues. As the discussion continues, it remains to be seen how these issues will be resolved and what changes will come to Canada's economy and society.
