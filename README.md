# Open-Hansard

This project aims to analyze and visualize the debates occurring in the Canadian Parliament, specifically the House of Commons, using Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the topics being discussed, the key players involved, and the tone and sentiment expressed during these debates.

To achieve this, I will be utilizing the official Hansard document of Canada, which provides a detailed record of all proceedings in the House of Commons. By applying LLMs to process and analyze the text data contained within Hansard, I hope to uncover insights into the key issues driving debate, the linguistic patterns employed by different parties, and the overall sentiment expressed during these debates.

Through this project, I aim to contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics at play in Canadian parliamentary politics, shedding light on the themes that unite or divide MPs, and providing a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and citizens alike. By leveraging LLMs, I hope to bring new perspectives and methods to the study of parliamentary debates, ultimately enhancing our comprehension of this critical institution.
